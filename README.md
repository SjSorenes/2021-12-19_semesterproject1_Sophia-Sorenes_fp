This is a website for an imagined science museum with the target audience being primary and middle school children.


## Description

Using only HTML and CSS, the aim of this project was to make a lightweight and interactive website for a science museum. 
The target audience was children aged 7-15 years old, and families with young children. The assignment asked for a website that was informative and appealing, 
that would attract both middle school pupils and their parents. The site should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience 
is inquisitive and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, but should encourage viewers to visit the museum itself. 

The website should be responsive and be easy to use on a variety of devices.

Creating this website required me to consider design principles, project management, communication technology, and developing with HTML/CSS.

Some points I especially focused on:

- Semantic HTML and CSS that followed DRY principles
- WCAG standards and universal design
- Responisve layout
